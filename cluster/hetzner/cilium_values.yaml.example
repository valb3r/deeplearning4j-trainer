# All Cilium helm values can be found at https://github.com/cilium/cilium/blob/master/install/kubernetes/cilium/values.yaml
# The following is a personal working and optimized example of Cilium helm values.

ipam:
  # -- Configure IP Address Management mode.
  mode: kubernetes

# -- Specify which network interfaces can run the eBPF datapath. This means
# that a packet sent from a pod to a destination outside the cluster will be
# masqueraded (to an output device IPv4 address), if the output device runs the
# program. When not specified, probing will automatically detect devices.
devices: "eth1"

# -- Configure the encapsulation configuration for communication between nodes.
# Possible values:
#   - disabled (native routing works, however it feels that geneve is more stable, but we may be wrong)
#   - vxlan
#   - geneve (it's basically a better version of vxlan)
tunnel: geneve

# -- Configure Kubernetes specific configuration
k8s:
  # -- requireIPv4PodCIDR enables waiting for Kubernetes to provide the PodCIDR
  # range via the Kubernetes node resource
  requireIPv4PodCIDR: true

# -- Configure the kube-proxy replacement in Cilium BPF datapath
# Valid options are "disabled", "probe", "partial", "strict".
# ref: https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/gettingstarted/kubeproxy-free/
kubeProxyReplacement: strict
